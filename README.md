# pong-game
A very simple 2D pong game written in JavaScript with Unity.

To install, either:
  - open it via ![Dropbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h-z0AyG42k&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4_IYZY2V0G3IUYcx1zZkJe) and follow the instructions (doesn't seem to work in some browsers),
  - open the .html file in 'Pong_data/Builds/Pong Web Build' to run locally,
  - open the .app file in 'Pong_data/Builds' to run the Mac app.

Use W/S keys for the left player and Up & Down arrow keys for the right player.

Strongly influenced by Brackey's 2D game ![tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h-z0AyG42k&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4_IYZY2V0G3IUYcx1zZkJe). I used some of the assets in Brackey's ![2D Mega Pack](http://devassets.com/assets/2d-mega-pack/), but all the sounds and music were made by me and friends.

Enjoy!
